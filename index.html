          <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
          We aim to empower users with a user-friendly interface that allows them to input sentences, and in return, receive those sentences refined to align with the stringent standards set forth by the STE (Simplified Technical English) style guide. Our mission is to harness the power of language processing technology by fine-tuning an existing, open-sourced, commercially available Large Language Model (LLM) to seamlessly transform text into adherence with the STE style guide. Our commitment is to provide a precise, efficient, and accessible solution that elevates the quality of written communication in the style of Simplified Technical English.
